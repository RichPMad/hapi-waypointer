This document describes v2 of the Auth0 API, which is meant to be used by back-end servers or trusted parties performing
administrative tasks. Generally speaking, anything that can be done through the Auth0 dashboard (and more) can also be
done through this API.

APIv2 is intended as a replacement for APIv1, an earlier version of the API. APIv2 is production ready and is recommended
for any new integrations. To learn more about the differences between v1 and v2, please refer to this document.

This API is separate from the publicly accessible authentication API, which is meant to be used by front-ends and
untrusted parties.
